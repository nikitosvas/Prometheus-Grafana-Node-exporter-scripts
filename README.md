# Prometheus and Grafana
## Scripts for Prometheus Monitoring System

Several scripts for automatic installation of prometheus, node_exporter and grafana on the server.

*Run the scripts locally on the desired server or register the appropriate block in the Ansible playbook.*
*The script uses a local IP address. If you run it on remote servers, it will work on their IP.*
